For example, `FBMExchange` is a simulated exchange, which generates pricing and volume data using fractional brownian motion (FBM). Since its price is simulated, the trades it executes must be simulated as well. The exchange uses a simple slippage model to simulate price and volume slippage on trades, though like almost everything in TensorTrade, this slippage model can easily be swapped out for something more complex.\n",

Under the hood, `SimulatedExchange` only requires a `data_frame` of price history to generate its simulations. This data_frame can either be provided by a coded implementation such as `FBMExchange`, or at runtime such as in the following example."

If a pipeline has been added to a particular exchange, then observations will be passed through the `FeaturePipeline` before being output to the environment.

For example, if we were using a discrete action space of 3 actions (0 = `hold`, 1 = `buy 100%`, 2 = `sell 100%`), our learning agent does not need to know that returning an action of 1 is equivalent to buying an instrument. Rather, our agent needs to know the reward for returning an action of 1 in specific circumstances, and can leave the implementation details of converting actions to trades to the `ActionStrategy`.\n",
